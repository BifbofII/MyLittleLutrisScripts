#Tomb Raider I Gold - Gog

Description:
This script will install "Tomb Raider I Gold" Gog edition with strong graphics improvements.
During install please let all options by default.
This script uses different projects:
GLRage: https://github.com/ata4/glrage
TombATI: http://www.glidos.net/tombati.html
HD textures packs: http://www.tombraiderxtra.com/

Big thanks to people who gave their time to permit us playing this game in the best conditions.

Technical notes:
- When the "Tomb Raider Importer" dialog box will appear, just click "install". 
- as TR1 has insufficient controller support, I invite you to use a keymapper. You will find profiles for x360 (Antimicro) and Steam Controller (sc-controller) in the "gamepad profiles" folder.
