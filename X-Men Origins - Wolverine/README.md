X-Men Origins - Wolverine - DVD

Description:
This script will install "X-Men Origins: Wolverine" DVD edition.
During install please let all options by default.
Big thanks to people who gave their time to permit us playing this game in the best conditions.

Technical notes:
- Supports natively x360 controller
- Known issue: the setup program is a little unstable, there will be no picture during install and it will crash at the end. Happily, the game will be fully installed before the crash. (cf. Wine bug https://bugs.winehq.org/show_bug.cgi?id=35319)
- You will need the game DVD only one time during install
- Please report issue concerning this script on my github page:
