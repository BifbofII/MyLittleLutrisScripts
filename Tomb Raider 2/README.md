#Tomb Raider II Gold - Gog

Description:
This script will install "Tomb Raider 2 Gold" Gog edition with support for modern resolution.
During install please let all options by default.
This script uses different projects:
dgvoodoo2:: http://www.dege.freeweb.hu/
TR2Main by Arsunt: https://github.com/Arsunt/TR2Main
innoextract: http://constexpr.org/innoextract/
ffmpeg: https://ffmpeg.org/

Thanks to the people who contributed to help us playing this game in the best conditions.

Technical notes:
- as TR2 has insufficient controller support, I invite you to use a keymapper. You will find profiles for x360 (Antimicro) and Steam Controller (sc-controller) in the "gamepad profiles" folder.
