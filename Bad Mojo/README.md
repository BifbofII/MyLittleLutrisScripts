# Bad Mojo Redux - GOG

Description:
This script will install "Bad Mojo Redux" Gog edition with support for modern computer config.
During install please let all options by default.
Thanks to the people who contributed to play this game in the best conditions.

Technical notes:
- Kown issue: this game has a 640x480 resolution. If you launch it in a virtual Wine desktop, the Wine window will be resized to  640x480 resolution. The only workaround, for the moment, is to disable Wine virtual desktop. Before trying this workaround, verify your screen can support 640x480 resolution.
