Thanks to the people who contributed to play this game in the best conditions.

Technical notes:
- as "Tomb Raider IV: The Times exclusive level" has insufficient controller support, I invite you to use a keymapper. You will find profiles for x360 (Antimicro) and Steam Controller (sc-controller) in the "gamepad profiles" folder.
