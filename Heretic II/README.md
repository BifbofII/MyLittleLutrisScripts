Thanks to the people who helped us play this game in the best conditions.

Technical notes:
The game patched during install to use your desktop resolution.
You can choose your game preferred language during install. 
You just need the H2 cd during install, then you could play game without it.
Know issues:
Heretic II will crash if you launch directly a new game (Wine Bug 40468 https://bugs.winehq.org/show_bug.cgi?id=40468)
Workaround: start the tutorial level first, escape to the main menu, start a new game. This bug only occurs if you launch a new game directly, not when you load or save a game.
H2 controller support is insufficient . Instead I invite you to use a keymapper like Antimicro or sc-controller. You will find profiles for x360 and Steam Controller in the "gamepad profiles" folder.
