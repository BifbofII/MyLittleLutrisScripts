This script will install "Heretic II" CD edition with support for modern computer configuration.

During install please let all options by default.

This script uses different projects:
DxWnd: https://sourceforge.net/projects/dxwnd/
GNU32 tools: http://gnuwin32.sourceforge.net/
Mplayer: http://www.mplayerhq.hu/design7/news.html

Thanks to the people who helped us play this game in the best conditions.


Heretic II will crash if you launch directly a new game (same bug on Windows).
Workaround: Start the tutorial level first, escape to the main menu, start a new game.
This bug only occurs if you launch a new game directly, not when you load or save a game.
