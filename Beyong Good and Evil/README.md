# Beyond Good & Evil - GOG

Description:
This script will install "Beyond Good & Evil" Gog edition with support for modern resolution.
During install please let all options by default.
This script uses ps2wide widescreen patch: http://ps2wide.net/
Thanks to the people who contributed to play this game in the best conditions.

Technical notes:
- BGE Gog edition does not natively support controller, only Keyboard.  For a better gaming experience, you will find profiles for x360 and Steam Controller in the "gamepad profiles" folder.
