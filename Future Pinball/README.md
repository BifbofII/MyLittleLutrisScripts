Back to the future utlimate 3.0 mod and others nice tables here: http://www.pinsimdb.org/fr/flipper/table-24475-back_to_the_future_ultimate_3_0_mod

Technical notes:
- main controls: F5=launch table, ESC=exit table, 5=add coins, 1=start, ENTER=pull plunger, mouse right button and left button click: flippers
- fp supports natively x360 gamepad. But if like me you prefer use triggers as flippers, you will find x360 (Antimicro) and Steam controller (sc-controller) profiles in "gamepad profiles" folder.
known issues:
- not BAM tables compatible
- use mouse or gamepad for flippers, keyboard keys does not respond enough faster to play
