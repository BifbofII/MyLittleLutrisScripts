Thanks to the people who contributed to play this game in the best conditions.


Technical notes:
- 1.08 HOV update
- multiplayer OK
known issues:
- multiplayer, join button, miss the "j" of "join"
- multiplayer, join, tab news is empty
- when joining servers, sometimes the game crashes and complains: "The file '..\Textures\Drgnkeep.utx' contains unrecognizable data free(): invalid pointer"
Same result with Decap1.utx and Galleon.utx files.
- if you obtain "maps mismatch" error message, just erase the maps then the game will automatically upload the right map.
Gamepad: Rune Classic has bad controller support. Instead I invite you to use a keymapper like Antimicro or sc-controller. You will find profiles for x360 and Steam Controller in the "gamepad profiles" folder.
